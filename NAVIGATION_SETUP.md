# Navigation Setup - Auth First Flow

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Screens Navigation
- Added `Screens.Login` to the sealed class in `modules/core/presentation/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/hooked/core/nav/Screens.kt`
- Login screen is now part of the navigation graph

### 2. Updated HookedApp Navigation
- Changed `startDestination` from `Screens.CatchGrid` to `Screens.Login`
- Added `LoginScreen` composable to the NavHost
- Configured navigation from Login to CatchGrid with proper animations
- Added `popUpTo(Screens.Login) { inclusive = true }` to prevent back navigation to login after successful authentication

### 3. Navigation Flow
1. **App Launch**: Shows `LoginScreen` first
2. **Successful Login**: Navigates to `CatchGrid` and removes login from back stack
3. **Slide Animation**: Login slides out left, CatchGrid slides in from right

### 4. Login Screen Integration
- Uses test credentials: `test@example.com` / `password`
- Shows loading state during authentication
- Displays validation errors for invalid inputs
- Calls `onNavigateToHome` callback on successful login

## Navigation Structure
```
Login (start) -> CatchGrid -> SubmitCatch
                     â†“
                CatchDetails
```

## Key Features
- **Authentication Gate**: Users must login before accessing the app
- **No Back Navigation**: After login, users cannot navigate back to login screen
- **Smooth Animations**: Proper slide transitions between screens
- **Error Handling**: Login failures are handled gracefully
- **Form Validation**: Email and password validation before submission

## Test Credentials
- Email: `test@example.com`
- Password: `password`

The navigation setup is complete and ready for testing. The existing compilation errors in the catches module are unrelated to the navigation changes.
