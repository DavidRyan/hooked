# iNaturalist Computer Vision API Test Commands

# Basic curl command to test species identification:
curl -X POST "https://api.inaturalist.org/v1/computervision/score_image" \
  -F "image=@test_image.jpg" \
  -H "Accept: application/json"

# Test with existing fish images in uploads:
curl -X POST "https://api.inaturalist.org/v1/computervision/score_image" \
  -F "image=@priv/static/uploads/catches/4104abd1-f078-4129-9790-cbf7d43545ba-test-fish.png" \
  -H "Accept: application/json"

# Test with another fish image:
curl -X POST "https://api.inaturalist.org/v1/computervision/score_image" \
  -F "image=@priv/static/uploads/catches/7ebca80b-2328-4b79-b4bc-279c36f6b67e-test-fish.png" \
  -H "Accept: application/json"

# Expected response format:
# {
#   "results": [
#     {
#       "taxon": {
#         "name": "Micropterus salmoides",  // Scientific name
#         "preferred_common_name": "Largemouth Bass"
#       },
#       "score": 0.85
#     }
#   ]
# }

# The Elixir code extracts: best["taxon"]["name"] 
# This gets the scientific name, not the common name

# To get largemouth bass, you would expect:
# - Scientific name: "Micropterus salmoides" 
# - Common name: "Largemouth Bass" (in preferred_common_name field)
